PCA analysis of the Dynamic PET (positron emission tomography) FDG ([F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose) study in the Brain-Tumor-FDG data

PCA is a mathematical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables
into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. The number of principal components is less than or 
equal to the number of original variables. This transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the largest
possible variance (that is, accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible), and each succeeding component in turn has
the highest variance possible under the constraint that it be orthogonal to (i.e., uncorrelated with) the preceding components.  
PCA is sensitive to the relative scaling of the original variables. In order to compute this using PCA we obtain feature matrix A from 
scan.
